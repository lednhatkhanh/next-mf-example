# Nextjs and Module Federation example

# Setup

- Run `yarn`
- Run `yarn dev`
- Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

# Problems

- `create` does not generate `remoteEntry.js` file, it shows `404 not found error`
- `/about` shows a blank page when navigate from `home`, need to reload the page for it to work.
